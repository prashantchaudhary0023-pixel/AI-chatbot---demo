# AI-chatbot---demo
A factual, retrieval-based chatbot that answers questions using only the SQuAD 2.0 dataset. Built with LangChain, OpenAI, and Pinecone, it uses semantic search to find relevant context and returns grounded, non-creative responses. Designed for accurate, source-based QA with no hallucinations.
